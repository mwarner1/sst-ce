This is the README file for the Solaris (tm) Security Toolkit ("JASS")

----------------- Documentation --------------------

The Sun BluePrints articles that were originally found in this directory
containing Sun's recommended practices on securing the Solaris Operating
Enviroment in addition to the articles outlining the installation, 
configuration and use of the Sun Security Toolkit: Community Edition have been removed
in order help ensure that our users have access to the most current 
information.  The Sun BluePrints for a variety of information security
topics can be found at:

   http://www.sun.com/security/blueprints/

The most current version of Sun Security Toolkit: Community Edition documentation takes
the form of the Administration Guide and Reference Guide.  These are
downloadable from the same location as the Sun Security Toolkit: Community Edition
software was downloaded from.

The previous version of Sun Security Toolkit: Community Edition documentation takes
the form of the Sun BluePrint publication "Securing Systems with the 
Sun Security Toolkit: Community Edition" (ISBN 0131410717, Prentice Hall).
