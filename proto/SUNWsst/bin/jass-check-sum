# The purpose of this script is to identify those files (modified by the
# Sun Security Toolkit: Community Edition) that have been altered since their checksums
# were originally saved in the Sun Security Toolkit: Community Edition repository
# (/var/opt/SUNWsst/run/*/jass-checksums.txt).
#
# Note that only the last (most recent) checksum of a file is compared
# to the current file.  This will aid in determining if a file has been
# changed after being configured by the Sun Security Toolkit: Community Edition.
#
# If a given run has already been undone, it will be skipped in terms
# of processing for this script.
